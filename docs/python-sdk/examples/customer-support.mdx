A customer support AI Voice Agent with FAQ search, ticket management, and account management capabilities.

## What It Demonstrates

This example shows:

- ✅ Real-world use case implementation
- ✅ FAQ search tools
- ✅ Ticket management tools
- ✅ Account management tools
- ✅ Structured responses and confirmations
- ✅ Production-like patterns

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Kuralit SDK installed: `pip install kuralit`
- API keys:
  - `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` - Deepgram STT API key
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini LLM API key
  - `KURALIT_API_KEY` - Server API key (defaults to "demo-api-key")

## Features

Your customer support AI Voice Agent can:

- **🔍 FAQ Search** - Search knowledge base for common questions
- **🎫 Ticket Management** - Create, view, update, and list support tickets
- **👤 Account Management** - Get account and order information
- **💰 Actions** - Process refunds (with confirmation), escalate tickets

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Step 1: Define Support Tools

Create tools for customer support operations:

```python
def search_faq(query: str) -> str:
    """Search FAQ database for answers."""
    # Search implementation...

def create_ticket(subject: str, description: str, priority: str = "normal") -> str:
    """Create a support ticket."""
    # Ticket creation...

def get_ticket_status(ticket_id: str) -> str:
    """Get status of a support ticket."""
    # Status lookup...

def process_refund(order_id: str, amount: Optional[float] = None) -> str:
    """Process a refund for an order."""
    # Refund processing...
```

### Step 2: Create Support Toolkits

```python
from kuralit.tools import Toolkit

faq_tools = Toolkit(
    name="faq",
    tools=[search_faq],
    instructions="FAQ search tools for answering common questions."
)

ticket_tools = Toolkit(
    name="tickets",
    tools=[create_ticket, get_ticket_status, update_ticket, list_tickets],
    instructions="Ticket management tools for creating and managing support tickets."
)

account_tools = Toolkit(
    name="account",
    tools=[get_account_info, get_order_info],
    instructions="Account management tools for viewing customer and order information."
)
```

### Step 3: Configure Agent for Support

```python
agent_session = AgentSession(
    stt="deepgram/nova-2:en-US",
    llm="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-001",
    vad="silero/v3",
    turn_detection="multilingual/v1",
    tools=[faq_tools, ticket_tools, account_tools],
    instructions="""You are a customer support AI Voice Agent.
    
Help customers by:
- Answering questions from the FAQ
- Creating support tickets when needed
- Providing account and order information
- Processing refunds (with confirmation)

Always be polite, professional, and helpful.""",
)
```

## Full Code Structure

The example includes:

1. **FAQ Database** - In-memory knowledge base
2. **Ticket System** - Create, view, update tickets
3. **Account System** - Customer and order information
4. **Support Tools** - FAQ search, ticket management, account lookup
5. **Agent Configuration** - Customer support personality and instructions

## How to Run

```bash
python examples/customer_support_agent.py
```

## Expected Output

```
🚀 Starting Customer Support Agent server...
   Host: 0.0.0.0
   Port: 8000
   Connect at: ws://0.0.0.0:8000/ws

   Available features:
   🔍 FAQ Search: Answer common questions
   🎫 Tickets: Create and manage support tickets
   👤 Accounts: View account and order information
```

## Example Interactions

- **"How do I reset my password?"** → Uses `search_faq` tool
- **"I want to return my order"** → Uses `search_faq` or `create_ticket` tool
- **"What's the status of ticket 12345?"** → Uses `get_ticket_status` tool
- **"I need a refund for order ABC123"** → Uses `process_refund` tool (with confirmation)

## Key Concepts

### Structured Responses

Customer support agents need structured responses:

```python
def search_faq(query: str) -> str:
    """Search FAQ and return formatted answer."""
    # Search logic...
    return f"Answer: {answer}\n\nSource: FAQ Database"
```

### Confirmation Patterns

For destructive actions, require confirmation:

```python
def process_refund(order_id: str, amount: Optional[float] = None) -> str:
    """Process refund - requires confirmation."""
    # In production, this would require user confirmation
    return f"Refund processed for order {order_id}"
```

### Professional Instructions

Agent instructions set the tone:

```python
instructions="""You are a customer support AI Voice Agent.
Always be polite, professional, and helpful.
Escalate complex issues when needed."""
```

## Production Considerations

In production, you would:

- **Connect to real databases** - Replace in-memory storage
- **Integrate with ticketing systems** - Use actual ticket APIs
- **Add authentication** - Verify customer identity
- **Implement confirmation flows** - For refunds and other actions
- **Add logging and monitoring** - Track support interactions
