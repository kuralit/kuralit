STT plugins convert spoken audio into text that your AI Voice Agent can understand.

## What is STT?

Speech-to-Text (STT) is the process of converting spoken words into written text. In Kuralit, STT plugins:

- **Stream audio continuously** - Process audio in real-time
- **Provide interim results** - Show transcription as user speaks
- **Deliver final transcripts** - Complete utterance transcriptions
- **Support multiple languages** - Various language codes
