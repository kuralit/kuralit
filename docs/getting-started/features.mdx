description: "Learn about the three core pillars that make AI Voice Agents: Agents, Tools, and Real-Time Voice"
---

AI Voice Agents are conversational AI systems that can listen, think, and act. They combine three powerful capabilities:

1. **🤖 AI Agents** - The intelligence that understands and responds
2. **🛠️ Tools & Function Calling** - The capabilities that let them perform actions
3. **🎤 Real-Time Voice** - The interface that makes conversations natural

## Overview

AI Voice Agents work by combining these three components:

- **Agents** provide the conversational intelligence with context and personality
- **Tools** give agents capabilities through function calling (not just talking, but doing)
- **Voice** enables real-time spoken interaction with speech-to-text and turn detection

Together, they create AI Voice Agents that can have natural voice conversations and perform actions.

## 🤖 AI Agents

**The intelligence behind AI Voice Agents**

AI Agents are the conversational intelligence that powers your AI Voice Agent. They understand context, maintain conversation history, and respond naturally.

### What They Do

- Understand natural language input
- Maintain conversation context across multiple turns
- Generate natural, contextual responses
- Follow instructions and personality guidelines

### How They Work

AI Agents use Large Language Models (LLMs) to process conversations. You configure them with:

- **Instructions**: Define the agent's personality and behavior
- **Context**: Conversation history and session management
- **Tools**: Functions the agent can call to perform actions

<CodeGroup>
```python
# Creating an AI Voice Agent
from kuralit.server.agent_session import AgentSession

agent = AgentSession(
    llm="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-001",  # The AI brain
    instructions="You are a helpful AI Voice Agent assistant",
    tools=[...],  # Tools the agent can use
    # ... voice configuration
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Why It Matters

**This is what makes your AI Voice Agent intelligent.** Without AI Agents, you'd just have a voice-to-text system. With AI Agents, you have a conversational partner that understands context and responds naturally.

## 🛠️ Tools & Function Calling

**What makes AI Voice Agents capable**

Tools are functions that your AI Voice Agent can call to perform actions. They transform your agent from a conversational system into a capable assistant that can actually do things.

### What They Do

- Enable agents to perform actions (not just talk)
- Connect to APIs, databases, and external services
- Execute Python functions
- Return results that agents can use in responses

### How They Work

Tools are created from Python functions and organized into Toolkits:

<CodeGroup>
```python
# Define a tool function
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a location."""
    # Implementation here
    return f"Weather in {location}: sunny, 22°C"

# Create a toolkit
from kuralit.tools import Toolkit

weather_tools = Toolkit(
    name="weather",
    tools=[get_weather],
    instructions="Weather tools for getting current conditions"
)

# Use with your AI Voice Agent
agent = AgentSession(
    tools=[weather_tools],
    # ...
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Types of Tools

1. **Custom Python Functions** - Write your own functions
2. **REST API Tools** - Load from Postman collections
3. **Toolkits** - Group related tools together

### Why It Matters

**This is what makes your AI Voice Agent useful.** Tools enable your agent to:
- Search the web
- Access databases
- Call APIs
- Perform calculations
- Execute any action you can code

## 🎤 Real-Time Voice

**What makes AI Voice Agents conversational**

Real-Time Voice enables natural spoken conversations with your AI Voice Agent. It handles speech-to-text, voice activity detection, and turn-taking.

### What It Does

- Converts speech to text in real-time
- Detects when the user is speaking
- Determines when the user has finished speaking
- Enables natural turn-taking in conversations

### How It Works

The voice pipeline processes audio through multiple stages:

```
Audio Input → VAD → STT → Turn Detection → AI Agent → Response
```

1. **VAD (Voice Activity Detection)** - Detects when speech starts and ends
2. **STT (Speech-to-Text)** - Converts audio to text
3. **Turn Detection** - Determines when the user has finished speaking
4. **AI Agent** - Processes the text and generates a response

<CodeGroup>
```python
# Configuring voice for your AI Voice Agent
agent = AgentSession(
    stt="deepgram/nova-2:en-US",        # Speech-to-Text
    vad="silero/v3",                     # Voice Activity Detection
    turn_detection="multilingual/v1",     # Turn Detection
    llm="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-001",  # AI Agent
    # ...
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Components

- **STT Plugins**: Deepgram, Google Cloud STT
- **VAD Plugins**: Silero (on-device, no API needed)
- **Turn Detection**: Multilingual turn detector

### Why It Matters

**This is what makes your AI Voice Agent conversational.** Without voice, you'd have a text chat system. With voice, you have natural spoken conversations that feel like talking to a person.

## How They Work Together to Create AI Voice Agents

Here's the complete flow of how all three components work together:

```
User speaks → VAD detects speech → STT converts to text → 
Turn Detection determines end of turn → AI Agent processes → 
Agent uses Tools if needed → Agent generates response → 
Response sent back to user
```

### Complete Example

<CodeGroup>
```python
# Building a complete AI Voice Agent
from kuralit.server.agent_session import AgentSession
from kuralit.tools import Toolkit

# Define tools
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a location."""
    return f"Weather in {location}: sunny, 22°C"

# Create your complete AI Voice Agent
agent = AgentSession(
    # 🎤 Real-Time Voice
    stt="deepgram/nova-2:en-US",
    vad="silero/v3",
    turn_detection="multilingual/v1",
    
    # 🤖 AI Agent
    llm="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-001",
    instructions="You are a helpful AI Voice Agent with weather tools",
    
    # 🛠️ Tools
    tools=[Toolkit(tools=[get_weather])]
)

# Your AI Voice Agent can now:
# - Listen to voice input
# - Understand what the user wants
# - Use tools to get information
# - Respond naturally
```
</CodeGroup>

### Real-World Use Cases

- **Customer Support AI Voice Agents** - Handle support calls with FAQ and ticket management
- **Voice Assistant AI Voice Agents** - Personal assistants with calendar, weather, and reminders
- **Enterprise AI Voice Agents** - Business applications with API integrations
