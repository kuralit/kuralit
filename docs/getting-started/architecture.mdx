Learn about the internal architecture of Kuralit and how all components work together.

## System Architecture

The Kuralit system consists of three main components working together:

## Detailed Architecture Components

### Flutter App Layer

![Flutter App Details](/images/architecture/flutter-app-layer.jpg)

The Flutter application layer handles:
- User interface and interactions
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Audio capture and streaming
- UI templates and overlays

### Kuralit Framework

![Framework Details](/images/architecture/kuralit-framework.jpg)

The Kuralit Framework provides:
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Protocol handling
- Event management
- Connection management

### AI Voice Agent Server

![Server Architecture](/images/architecture/server-architecture.png)

The Python-based AI Voice Agent Server includes:
- **Voice Processing**: Speech-to-text, voice activity detection, turn detection
- **AI Agent**: Large language model integration and conversation management
- **Tools**: Function calling and API integration capabilities

## Data Flow

1. **User Input** → Flutter app captures voice/text input
2. **WebSocket** → Real-time communication via Kuralit Framework
3. **Server Processing** → AI Voice Agent processes with Voice + Agent + Tools
4. **Response** → Server sends response back through WebSocket
5. **Display** → Flutter app displays response to user

## Component Interactions

- **Voice ↔ Agent**: Voice input is transcribed and sent to the agent
- **Agent ↔ Tools**: Agent can call tools (like REST APIs) to perform actions
- **Agent ↔ Voice**: Agent responses can be converted to voice output
