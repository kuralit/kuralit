Turn detection plugins determine when a user has finished speaking and it's the agent's turn to respond.

## What is Turn Detection?

Turn detection analyzes conversation context to predict:

- **End-of-turn probability** - Likelihood that the user has finished speaking
- **Dynamic endpointing** - Adjusts delay based on probability
  - High probability → Shorter delay (0.5s)
  - Low probability → Longer delay (3.0s)

## How Turn Detection Works

Turn detection processes conversation context:

```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

<CodeGroup>
```python
from kuralit.server.agent_session import AgentSession

# Using Multilingual Turn Detector
agent = AgentSession(
    turn_detection="multilingual/v1",  # Multilingual turn detector
    # ...
)
```
</CodeGroup>
