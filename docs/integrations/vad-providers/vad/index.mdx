VAD plugins detect when speech starts and ends in the audio stream.

## What is VAD?

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) analyzes audio to determine:

- **START_OF_SPEECH** - User has started speaking
- **END_OF_SPEECH** - User has stopped speaking
- **CONTINUING** - Speech is ongoing

VAD helps your AI Voice Agent know when to listen and when to respond.
