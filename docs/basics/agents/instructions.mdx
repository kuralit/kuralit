Instructions define your AI Voice Agent's personality, behavior, and capabilities. Well-written instructions are crucial for creating effective AI Voice Agents.

## What are Instructions?

Instructions are text prompts that tell your agent:

- **Who it is** - Role and identity
- **How to behave** - Personality and tone
- **What to do** - Tasks and responsibilities
- **What not to do** - Boundaries and limitations

## Writing Effective Instructions

### Be Specific

<CodeGroup>
```python
# ❌ Too vague
instructions="You are a helpful assistant."

# ✅ Specific and clear
instructions="""You are a customer support AI Voice Agent for an e-commerce platform.

Your responsibilities:
- Answer questions about products, orders, and shipping
- Help customers with returns and refunds
- Escalate complex issues to human support
- Be polite, professional, and empathetic"""
```
</CodeGroup>

### Set Boundaries

<CodeGroup>
```python
instructions="""You are a financial advisor AI Voice Agent.

What you can do:
- Provide general financial information
- Explain investment concepts
- Help with budgeting advice

What you cannot do:
- Provide specific investment recommendations
- Guarantee returns
- Replace professional financial advice

Always recommend consulting a licensed financial advisor for major decisions."""
```
</CodeGroup>

### Include Examples

<CodeGroup>
```python
instructions="""You are a travel assistant AI Voice Agent.

When users ask about flights:
- Provide flight information from available sources
- Compare prices when possible
- Suggest best times to book

Example responses:
- "I found flights from New York to London starting at $450."
- "The best time to book is typically 6-8 weeks in advance."
- "I can help you compare prices across different airlines.""""
```
</CodeGroup>

## Instruction Priority

Instructions are loaded in this priority order:

1. **Direct parameter** - `instructions="..."` in AgentSession (highest)
2. **Environment variable** - `KURALIT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS`
3. **Default** - Generated default instructions (lowest)

<CodeGroup>
```python
# Direct parameter (highest priority)
agent = AgentSession(
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    # ...
)

# Environment variable (fallback)
# KURALIT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS=You are a helpful assistant.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### Do's

- ✅ **Be specific** - Clearly define the agent's role
- ✅ **Set boundaries** - Define what the agent should and shouldn't do
- ✅ **Include examples** - Show desired response style
- ✅ **Keep it concise** - Long instructions can be less effective
- ✅ **Test and iterate** - Refine instructions based on results

### Don'ts

- ❌ **Don't be too vague** - "Be helpful" is not enough
- ❌ **Don't contradict yourself** - Avoid conflicting instructions
- ❌ **Don't make it too long** - Keep focused and relevant
- ❌ **Don't forget context** - Consider how tools affect behavior
