AI Voice Agents are the conversational intelligence that powers your applications. They understand context, maintain conversation history, and respond naturally using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## What are Agents?

Agents are the "brain" of your AI Voice Agent system. They:

- **Understand natural language** - Process user input in natural language
- **Maintain context** - Remember conversation history across multiple turns
- **Generate natural responses** - Respond in a conversational, helpful manner
- **Use tools** - Call functions and APIs to perform actions
- **Handle voice** - Process real-time voice input and respond

## How Agents Work

Agents use Large Language Models (LLMs) to process conversations. They are configured with:

- **Instructions** - Define the agent's personality and behavior
- **Context** - Conversation history and session management
- **Tools** - Functions the agent can call to perform actions
