title: "Multi-turn Conversations"

Multi-turn conversations enable natural, context-aware interactions with your AI Voice Agents.

## What are Multi-turn Conversations?

Multi-turn conversations are conversations where:

- **Context is maintained** - Agent remembers previous turns
- **References work** - "What about tomorrow?" refers to previous context
- **Natural flow** - Feels like talking to a person

## Example

<CodeGroup>
```python
# Turn 1
User: "What's the weather in London?"
Agent: "The weather in London is cloudy, 15°C."

# Turn 2 (agent remembers London from previous turn)
User: "What about tomorrow?"
Agent: "Tomorrow in London will be sunny, 18°C."

# Turn 3 (agent remembers the conversation)
User: "And the day after?"
Agent: "The day after tomorrow in London will be partly cloudy, 16°C."
```
</CodeGroup>

## How It Works

### Context Maintenance

The agent automatically maintains context:

1. **Stores messages** - All user and agent messages
2. **Includes tool results** - Tool execution results in context
3. **Uses history** - Full conversation history available to LLM
4. **Maintains session** - Each session has isolated context

### Turn Flow

```
Turn 1: User → Agent
    ↓ (context stored)
Turn 2: User → Agent (with context from Turn 1)
    ↓ (context updated)
Turn 3: User → Agent (with context from Turns 1 & 2)
```

## Best Practices

### Clear References

- ✅ **Be specific** - "What about tomorrow?" works if context is clear
- ✅ **Provide context** - "What's the weather in London tomorrow?" is clearer
- ✅ **Use consistent terms** - Use same terminology throughout

### Context Management

- **Keep conversations focused** - Long conversations may exceed limits
- **Use tools effectively** - Tools help maintain context
- **Clear session boundaries** - Start new sessions for new topics
