STT converts spoken audio into text that your AI Voice Agent can understand.

## What is STT?

Speech-to-Text (STT) is the process of converting spoken words into written text. In Kuralit, STT:

- **Streams audio continuously** - Process audio in real-time
- **Provides interim results** - Show transcription as user speaks
- **Delivers final transcripts** - Complete utterance transcriptions
- **Supports multiple languages** - Various language codes

## How STT Works

STT plugins process audio through this flow:
