Real-time voice enables natural spoken conversations with your AI Voice Agents. It processes audio input through Speech-to-Text (STT), Voice Activity Detection (VAD), and turn detection.

## What is Voice Streaming?

Voice streaming enables your AI Voice Agent to:

- **Receive voice input** - Process audio in real-time
- **Convert speech to text** - Use STT to transcribe audio
- **Detect speech activity** - Use VAD to know when users are speaking
- **Detect conversation turns** - Know when users have finished speaking
- **Respond naturally** - Enable natural turn-taking in conversations

## Audio Pipeline

The complete audio processing flow:

```
Audio Input
    ↓
VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
    ↓ (detects speech start/end)
STT (Speech-to-Text)
    ↓ (converts audio to text)
Turn Detection
    ↓ (determines end of turn)
AI Agent (LLM)
    ↓ (processes text and generates response)
Response to User
```

## Quick Example

<CodeGroup>
```python
from kuralit.server.agent_session import AgentSession

# Voice-enabled agent
agent = AgentSession(
    stt="deepgram/nova-2:en-US",        # Speech-to-Text
    vad="silero/v3",                     # Voice Activity Detection
    turn_detection="multilingual/v1",     # Turn Detection
    llm="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-001",  # AI Agent
)
```
