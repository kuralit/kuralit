title: "Voice Activity Detection (VAD)"
---


VAD detects when speech starts and ends in the audio stream, helping your AI Voice Agent know when to listen and when to respond.

## What is VAD?

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) analyzes audio to determine:

- **START_OF_SPEECH** - User has started speaking
- **END_OF_SPEECH** - User has stopped speaking
- **CONTINUING** - Speech is ongoing

## How VAD Works

VAD processes audio frames:

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

<CodeGroup>
```python
from kuralit.server.agent_session import AgentSession

# Using Silero VAD
agent = AgentSession(
    vad="silero/v3",  # Silero VAD v3
    # ...
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Sample Rates

VAD requires specific sample rates:

- **8000 Hz** - Telephone quality
- **16000 Hz** - Standard quality (recommended)

### Activation Threshold

Adjust sensitivity:

- **Lower (0.3-0.4)** - More sensitive, detects quieter speech
- **Default (0.5)** - Balanced
- **Higher (0.6-0.7)** - Less sensitive, reduces false positives

## Available Providers

- **Silero** - On-device, no API keys needed, works offline
